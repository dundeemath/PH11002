Typically, you encounter a specific topic, technique, or method, followed by a series of related exercises that reinforce that concept. While this approach can be beneficial for solidifying your understanding, it can also be somewhat disconnected from real-world challenges. In reality, problems often integrate multiple concepts and span various areas of mathematics, requiring a more holistic application of your knowledge.\n\nIn this module, we want to develop skills that help you to solve problems more generally. This will be done by engaging with tasks for which the solution method is not known in advance. To get good at attacking such open-ended tasks, you will also learn to reflect on your experiences and problem solving processes. This is because problem-solving is not simply a product of your mathematical resources (i.e., _what you know_), it is also a function of your perceptions of that knowledge that you derive from your _experiences_ with mathematics [@Schoenfeld:1985ps].\n\nIn this module, our focus is on developing skills that enhance your ability to solve problems in a broader context. We will achieve this by working on tasks for which the solution methods are not known in advance. To excel in tackling these open-ended challenges, you will also engage in reflecting on your experiences and the processes you use for problem-solving. This is essential because effective problem-solving relies not only on your mathematical resources, i.e., _what you know_, but also on how you perceive that knowledge [@Schoenfeld:1985ps]. Your perception of mathematics is influenced by your experiences, and a key aspect of this module will involve engaging in problem-solving tasks, both individually and collaboratively, and reflecting on these experiences to enhance your learning.\n\nThe purpose of this problem solving module is to:\n\n- build your confidence in solving unseen problems,\n- provide prompts to support reflection that will deepen your perception of mathematical knowledge (and its interconnections),\n- give generic support scaffolding problem solving (vs scaffolding the problem) that will provide a foundation for your development as a mathematician and scientist.",
