\chapter{Purpose}\label{sec-purpose}

\begin{quote}
``{[}T{]}he mathematician's main reason for existence is to solve
problems {[}\ldots{]} therefore, what mathematics \emph{really} consists
of is problems and solutions.'' (\citeproc{ref-Halmos:1980ps}{Halmos
1980})
\end{quote}

Throughout your mathematics and scientific journey, you have likely
faced a variety of problems that provided essential context to guide you
toward the ``appropriate'' solution methods. Typically, you encounter a
specific topic, technique, or method, followed by a series of related
exercises that reinforce that concept. While this approach can be
beneficial for solidifying your understanding, it can also be somewhat
disconnected from real-world challenges. In reality, problems often
integrate multiple concepts and span various areas of mathematics,
requiring a more holistic application of your knowledge.

In this module, we want to develop skills that help you to solve
problems more generally. This will be done by engaging with tasks for
which the solution method is not known in advance. To get good at
attacking such open-ended tasks, you will also learn to reflect on your
experiences and problem solving processes. This is because
problem-solving is not simply a product of your mathematical resources
(i.e., \emph{what you know}), it is also a function of your perceptions
of that knowledge that you derive from your \emph{experiences} with
mathematics (\citeproc{ref-Schoenfeld:1985ps}{Schoenfeld 1985}).

In this module, our focus is on developing skills that enhance your
ability to solve problems in a broader context. We will achieve this by
working on tasks for which the solution methods are not known in
advance. To excel in tackling these open-ended challenges, you will also
engage in reflecting on your experiences and the processes you use for
problem-solving. This is essential because effective problem-solving
relies not only on your mathematical resources, i.e., \emph{what you
know}, but also on how you perceive that knowledge
(\citeproc{ref-Schoenfeld:1985ps}{Schoenfeld 1985}). Your perception of
mathematics is influenced by your experiences, and a key aspect of this
module will involve engaging in problem-solving tasks, both individually
and collaboratively, and reflecting on these experiences to enhance your
learning.

The purpose of this problem solving module is to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  build your confidence in solving unseen problems,
\item
  provide prompts to support reflection that will deepen your perception
  of mathematical knowledge (and its interconnections),
\item
  give generic support scaffolding problem solving (vs scaffolding the
  problem) that will provide a foundation for your development as a
  mathematician and scientist.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Problems}\label{sec-problems}

\begin{quote}
``Problem. A doubtful or difficult question; a matter of inquiry,
discussion, or thought; a question that exercises the mind.''
(\citeproc{ref-OED:1989ps}{\emph{Oxford English Dictionary} 1989})
\end{quote}

Problems often involve more complexity than straightforward exercises in
that the method of solution is not proscribed. We will differentiate
between two types of problems and present a general framework,
introduced by Pólya in a series of monographs
(\citeproc{ref-Polya:1945hu}{Pólya 1945},
\citeproc{ref-Polya:1954oi}{1954a}, \citeproc{ref-Polya:1954ii}{1954b}),
for understanding problem solving. This framework is intended to serve
as a foundation for analysing your approach to problem solving.

\section{Two Types of Problems}\label{two-types-of-problems}

We distinguish between different types of problems based on the desired
goal.

\textbf{Problems to find.} The task is to produce or create an object
that satisfies specified conditions, which may include a number,
function, construction, example, counterexample, or algorithm. Common
prompts for these tasks include terms such as determine, compute,
construct, and classify. The success of these endeavors is evaluated
based on criteria such as correctness, completeness, and in some cases,
optimality or uniqueness.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, left=2mm, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, coltitle=black, breakable, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Example of a problem to find}, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, leftrule=.75mm]

Find all integers \(n\) such that \(n(n+1)\) is a perfect square.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Problems to prove.} The task is to justify a claim beyond
reasonable doubt. Typical prompts include: show, prove, disprove,
establish, and deduce. To be successful, one must ensure validity,
clarity, and appropriate use of definitions and prior results.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, left=2mm, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, coltitle=black, breakable, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Example of a problem to prove}, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, leftrule=.75mm]

Prove there are infinitely many primes congruent to \(\;3\mod 4\).

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, left=2mm, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, coltitle=black, breakable, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-warning-color}{\faExclamationTriangle}\hspace{0.5em}{Many problems mix both tasks!}, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, leftrule=.75mm]

Find all objects with property \(P\) and prove your list is complete.

\end{tcolorbox}

In this module, we will focus on \emph{problems to find}.

\section{Problem solving framework}\label{problem-solving-framework}

The problem solving framework (see \citeproc{ref-Polya:1945hu}{Pólya
1945}) is a four-phase cycle for tackling open-ended problems. The
phases of the problem solving framework are depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig-phases}; the name of each phase is listed in bold text,
with key terms in normal text. Knowing which phase of the framework you
are in may help you choose the best prompt to move forward (see the
table below in Section~\ref{sec-phases}).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=4.26in,height=7.05in]{02-problems_files/figure-latex/mermaid-figure-1.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-phases}The four phases of problem solving within a
problem solving cycle.}

\end{figure}%

The phases are roughly as follows. First, \textbf{understand the
problem}: identify data/givens, unknowns, and conditions/constraints;
restate it in your own words; sketch, tabulate, or probe small cases.
Next, \textbf{devise a plan} by choosing a route. Possible routes are to
work backward, look for patterns, simplify or specialise, use symmetry
or invariants, introduce an auxiliary object, estimate or bound, change
representation, or reduce to a known problem (we will investigate these
problem solving routes later in Chapter~\ref{sec-heuristics}). Then
\textbf{carry out \emph{your} plan}: execute cleanly, justify each step,
check subgoals, and pivot if a step stalls. Finally, \textbf{look back}:
verify the result, test edge cases, assess efficiency and clarity, and
capture the key idea. The final phase is \emph{essential}. Use the
framework to reflect on what you learned so your future problem solving
gets faster and more reliable.

\section{Phases of problem solving}\label{sec-phases}

Use Table Table~\ref{tbl-phases} as a working checklist and a reflection
guide, not a rigid recipe. As you tackle an open-ended problem, you
might find that you are ``stuck''. First, don't panic! Decide which
phase of the problem solving framework you are in and scan the prompts
in that row. Answering the prompt may lead to a concrete next action.
Reflect on this new action for a few minutes; if it stalls, return to
the table, pick a different prompt, or take a break. Over time, the
prompts will become more familiar and the process of solving an
open-ended problme will be less daunting.

\tabularnewline

\toprule
Phase & Purpose & Prompts to ask yourself & Useful tactics\\
\midrule
Understanding the problem & For a problem to find, understand the problem by making the unknown, data, and conditions precise. & What is unknown? What is given or what are the data? What conditions/constraints apply? Can I restate the task in my own words? What do small or extreme cases look like? What diagram/notation will help? & Define symbols. Draw a figure. List constraints. Test tiny cases. Identify edge cases. Rephrase the question. Separate various parts of the condition.\\
Devising a plan & Find the connection between the data and the unknown that provides a path towards a solution. & Have I seen the problem before? Have I seen the same problem in a slightly different form? Do I know a related problem? Do I know a theorem that might be useful? Can I work backward from the goal? Can I simplify/specialise first? What pattern, invariant, or symmetry might apply? Can I introduce an auxiliary element or change representation? Did I use all the data in devising my plan? Did I account for all the conditions? & Heuristics such as analogy; special/edge cases; generalisation; using invariants and symmetry; bounding/estimating; pigeonhole; substitution; set up equations or a new diagram.\\
Carry out your plan & Carry out plan, checking each step! & Would I be able to clearly explain that the step is correct? Can I prove that it is correct? Does each step follow from assumptions or known results? What subgoal can I verify now? If a step fails, which alternative route will I try next? & Justify steps. Prove lemmas. Compute carefully. Frequently take stock (checkpoint). Pivot quickly if a line of attack stalls. Don't panic.\\
Look back & Validate the result and reflect on learning. & Can I check the result? Can you explain your arguments? Does the result meet all conditions? Any counterexamples? Is it complete/optimal? Can I shorten or generalise the solution? Can I derive the result differently? What key idea made it work, and where else could it apply? & Record the central insight. Phases of the framework. Prompts answered. Heuristics used and how.\\

\chapter{Heuristics}\label{sec-heuristics}

``This principle is so perfectly general that no particular application
of it is possible.'' -- George Pólya
(\citeproc{ref-MacTutor:Polya}{MacTutor 2025a})
\end{quote}

\section{What is a heuristic?}\label{what-is-a-heuristic}

A \emph{heuristic} is a problem-solving device or strategy that provides
a way to seeing or approaching a problem. Choosing a suitable heuristic
often leads us closer to a solution. These strategies are versatile,
applying across a wide range of domains and topics. However, heuristics
alone are not enough to solve a problem; they must be combined with
relevant knowledge and a refined ability to select and deploy
mathematical resources effectively. By explicitly discussing and
reflecting on problem-solving strategies, we aim to bring the use of
heuristics into your conscious awareness. This focus will help you
create connections between different areas of mathematical knowledge and
enhance your reasoning skills. By honing these abilities, you will be
equipped with the tools necessary to become a proficient and literate
problem solver.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, left=2mm, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, coltitle=black, breakable, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-warning-color}{\faExclamationTriangle}\hspace{0.5em}{Heuristics will not replace shaky mastery of a subject!}, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, leftrule=.75mm]

``Despite the fact that their application cuts across various
mathematical domains, the successful implementation of heuristic
strategies in any particular domain often depends heavily on the
possession of specific subject matter knowledge.''
(\citeproc{ref-Schoenfeld:1985ps}{Schoenfeld 1985})

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Compendium of heuristics}\label{compendium-of-heuristics}

Below we include a collection of common heuristics, grouped by theme.
Each of these heuristics should be viewed as a label for a closely
related family of devices. That is, each heuristic in the compendium is
not precise enough to allow for unambiguous interpretation or
application to a particular problem! Key challenges that arise when
trying to apply any of these heuristics is firstly to select
appropriately and second to decompose the heuristic into a targeted
strategy that you can actually execute. Use the prompts to trigger
action.

For each heuristic we have indicated a source: (P) = after Pólya
(\citeproc{ref-Polya:1945hu}{Pólya 1945}); (M) = after Mahajan
(\citeproc{ref-Mahajan:2010ps}{Mahajan 2010}); (MF) = after
(\citeproc{ref-MichalewiczFogel:2004hu}{Michalewicz and Fogel 2004});
(Z) = after (\citeproc{ref-Zeitz:2016ps}{Zeitz 2016}). The list is not
exhaustive.

\chapter{Attitudes}\label{sec-attitudes}

\begin{quote}
``Many people who have not studied mathematics confuse it with
arithmetic and consider it a dry and fruitless science. In reality,
however, it is a science which requires a great amount of imagination.''
-- Sofia Kovalevskaya (\citeproc{ref-MacTutor:Kovalevskaya}{MacTutor
2025b})
\end{quote}

Effective problem solvers masterfully balance curiosity with discipline.
They begin by probing, playing, and hypothesizing, then move on to
justifying, checking, and reflecting on their findings. According to
Pólya, true progress originates from cycling through the four
problem-solving phases, maintaining a keen awareness of one's actions,
and a readiness to adapt when new evidence arises
(\citeproc{ref-Polya:1945hu}{Pólya 1945}). When progress stalls, adept
problem solvers pivot swiftly and consistently take time to ``look
back'' at their process.

\section{Selecting and pursuing an
approach}\label{selecting-and-pursuing-an-approach}

Begin by matching structure to strategy. Let the problem's cues choose
the method: a recurrence invites induction; symmetry points toward
invariants; a geometric flavour asks for a diagram and auxiliary
elements; unruly numbers suggest estimation or approximation.

Then commit to a strategy, but keep your course of action time-bound.
Choose one plan and pursue it deliberately for a few minutes. Set a
concrete checkpoint in advance so the decision to switch is not
emotional or driven by frustration (``If I cannot determine the number
of cases in twenty minutes, I will try another approach.'').

Finally, watch for traction. You are on the right track if relations
clarify, expressions simplify, or the number of cases shrinks. If
instead the algebra gets tedious, cases proliferate, or your reasoning
seems circular: stop, reframe the problem, and select a different
strategy.
