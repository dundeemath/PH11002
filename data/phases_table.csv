Understanding the problem,"For a problem to find, understand the problem by making the unknown, data, and conditions precise.",What is unknown? What is given or what are the data? What conditions/constraints apply? Can I restate the task in my own words? What do small or extreme cases look like? What diagram/notation will help?,Define symbols. Draw a figure. List constraints. Test tiny cases. Identify edge cases. Rephrase the question. Separate various parts of the condition. 
Devising a plan,Find the connection between the data and the unknown that provides a path towards a solution.,"Have I seen the problem before? Have I seen the same problem in a slightly different form? Do I know a related problem? Do I know a theorem that might be useful? Can I work backward from the goal? Can I simplify/specialise first? What pattern, invariant, or symmetry might apply? Can I introduce an auxiliary element or change representation? Did I use all the data in devising my plan? Did I account for all the conditions? ",Heuristics such as analogy; special/edge cases; generalisation; using invariants and symmetry; bounding/estimating; pigeonhole; substitution; set up equations or a new diagram.
Carry out your plan,"Carry out plan, checking each step!","Would I be able to clearly explain that the step is correct? Can I prove that it is correct? Does each step follow from assumptions or known results? What subgoal can I verify now? If a step fails, which alternative route will I try next?",Justify steps. Prove lemmas. Compute carefully. Frequently take stock (checkpoint). Pivot quickly if a line of attack stalls. Don't panic.
Look back,Validate the result and reflect on learning.,"Can I check the result? Can you explain your arguments? Does the result meet all conditions? Any counterexamples? Is it complete/optimal? Can I shorten or generalise the solution? Can I derive the result differently? What key idea made it work, and where else could it apply?",Record the central insight. Phases of the framework.
